I was thinking about this post: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1568298

I don't like the Google branding, either.

I figured out how to do it from this post:

One thing of note, you should change this in main.rb:

get '/all' do
 @emails = Email.all
 erb :show
end

It's obviously unsecure. If you're not too worried, you could simply obfuscate it and make it a really hard to guess URL ... or get fancy and put some authentication around it.
